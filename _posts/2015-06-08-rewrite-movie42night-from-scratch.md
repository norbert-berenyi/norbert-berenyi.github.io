I had very little time to do anything with [movie42night](http://movie42night.com/). Since I'm not the best JavaScript programmer, I'm planning to rewrite the website from scratch, using only `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `JavaScript`. It is a good way to practice, currently I'm in the phase looking for framework... :) So far [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) seems the best idea.

I'm also want to learn more about the whole Git system, so I will upload the site to GitHub. Feel free to help me if I do something completely wrong.

#### I will give you a introduction to how the site works now:

I'm using TMDB API to get the movie data. I have a easy method to generate a random movie Id, this function receives the Id and makes a request:
{% highlight php %}
public function getMovieById($movieID){
	$ch = curl_init();

	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL,
    self::API_URL . "movie/" . $movieID . "?api_key=" . $this->getApiKey() . "&language=" . $this->getLang());
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE);
	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, FALSE);

	curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
	  "Accept: application/json"
	));

	$response = curl_exec($ch);
	curl_close($ch);

	$response = json_decode($response, true);
	return $response;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is how the response look like:
{% highlight json %}

So basicly this is it. I receive every information, and put it together in a single HTML file. Since there is no user handling, nor database connection, I think I can get rid of PHP and use only JavaScript.
