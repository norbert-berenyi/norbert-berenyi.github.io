All right. So today I learned a lot about Jekyll, and I decided to try it out. I wanted to make a webpage for myself as a freelancer anyway, this is good learning. :)

About 2 hour of research I managed to put together this site. I'm planning to post about everything I find interesting or useful. Also about my work, witch is practicing in the `webdev` world.
