At this exact moment, I'm living with 3 erasmus students in the middle in Dohány street. One of the most frequent streets in Budapest. It started as a startup idea, and I'm ended up __paying €100 a month__. How? Let me tell you my story!

## My first usefull class at the University

I'm an electical engineering student I have many great classes, still I find everything Uni teaches you, is how to work for others. I found out early that I'm not the kind of person who wants to to that. So I decided to shift away into the Business world.

The class is named __How to start and manage an innovative company__,[^1] this is where I have meet my co-founders of [RoomieHunter](http://roomiehunter.com). The whole core team of the course was same minded as me, a perfect place to start your Entrepreneurship.

## The switch

Currently we are working on another idea with the same team, since we validated RoomieHunter and it turned out we can not create the company. Sadly the real estate market is very shady in Hungary.

The new idea is called [Roxxare](http://roxxare.com), it is an academy for eSports teams. I will write a post about it soon!
