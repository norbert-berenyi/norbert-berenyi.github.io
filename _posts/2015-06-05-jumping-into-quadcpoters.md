Well after watching several videos on youtube about aerial photography I decided to at least try the hobby. I'm really into the RC world, but never had the money to buy a decent toy. Since I'm working a lot now money is not a problem, time is...

So I started to research into the matter. [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/) is always a good place to start, this time I did not needed to go further. The most important thing was **not to buy anything expensive**, in theory I will break it anyway.

Cool! Now over to ebay. The first quad in the list was the `Syma X5C-1`. The quad looks fine I guess, the parts are cheap. Because I had no idea if it is a good or a bad starter quadcopter I decided to call for help: back to reddit.

### One of the first answers was really helpful: [/u/vabann](http://www.reddit.com/user/vabann)
The X5C-1 is super awesome fun! It was my first quad as well.

1. use prop guards at first! they will often bend up and get in the way of your props. bend them back down. once they start to break hopefully you are ready to fly without them.
2. once in a while the tiny gears that make the larger prop-driving gears spin will get out of place. if one prop starts to make a weird noise and stops spinning just flip it over and push the tiny gear back down into place.
3. the battery plugs will eventually get loose and shake out mid-flight. use a piece of bubble wrap or half a styrofoam peanut in the battery chamber to pad it in place.
4. there is an easy mode and a hard mode. switch between them using the button way up top left. L on transmitter screen means easy mode, H means hard mode. the difference is basically in how far it is allowed to tilt. i didnt know this at first and just thought that sometimes it was moody. It's a really great little drone, loads of fun and (I think) the best to have as your first drone.
5. get at least 5 extra batteries but MAKE SURE they're at least 600mah and 25c (many replacement batteries for the x5c are 20c)

So I ordered one. It comes with **2 extra batteries**, and two sets of blades.
The shipping time is nearly a month... If it arrives I'll make a post about it.

Until, here is a good review video:
