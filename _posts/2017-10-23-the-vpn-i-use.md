My first rule was to find a company that will protect my identity. Moldova is a good location for a data privacy service because the country lies just outside of the EU. This makes it free from EU data retention obligations. It is also right next door to Romania, which is fast becoming a VPN powerhouse.

My second rule was to find a provider I can try befor purchasing, ensuring I can use it over all my devices. [They provide 24 hours for free!](https://www.cactusvpn.com/free-vpn/)

A huge bonus is that CactusVPN offers five service plans. If you don’t think you’ll need to access servers in nine countries, you can save money by selecting a cut-down service. You get an allowance of five simultaneous connections on all plans.

### According to [bestvpn.com](https://www.bestvpn.com/cactusvpn-review/) it is secure:

<blockquote>

	<p>CactusVPN states that it does not hold “traffic, DNS reqs, timestamps, IPs, bandwidth, connection logs or any other type of logs that can be tracked to a single person.” This is possible because the home country of this VPN service is outside of the political mainstream of the West, where the threat of terrorism has overridden national commitments to privacy.</p>

	<p>The company admits that it will hand over any data on file should the authorities arrive with a subpoena. Realistically, few private businesses would do otherwise. However, there can be no trace of your activities through the VPN service because the necessary connection data is not stored after disconnection.</p>

</blockquote>

I am using it on all my devices, it is fast, not even noticeable. I reccomend it for everyone!
