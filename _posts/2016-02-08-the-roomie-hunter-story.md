At this exact moment, I'm living with 3 erasmus students in the middle of Budapest in Dohány street. One of the most frequent streets. It started as a startup idea, and I'm ended up __living here for €150 a month__. How? Let me tell me my story!

##My first usefull class at the University

I'm an electical engineering student I have many great classes, still I find everything Uni teaches you, is how to work for others. I found out early that I'm not the kind of person who wants to to that. So I decided to shift away into the Business world.

The class is named <span class="bg-dark-gray white">How to start and manage an innovative comany</span>, [^1] this is where I have meet my co-founders of RoomieHunter. The whole core team of the course was same minded as me, a perfect place to start your Entrepreneurship.
