  Hey there! I created this site to learn about something new, witch was Jekyll, after all I decided to keep the site and post stuff... I hope you like what you see.
</p>

<h3>Current projects</h3>

<p>
  At the moment I am working at <a href="http://www.gentherm.com/" target="_blank">Gentherm</a> as a Test Labor trainee, and I am a student at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Other than these, I am working on a site <a href="http://movie42night.com/" target="_blank">Movie42Night</a>, and plenty of other small sites.
</p>

<h3>Movie42Night</h3>

The site recommends random movies to watch. It is using Bootsrap and the TMDB API. And is build mainly in PHP. Since the site does not use any database I am planning to upgrade it so it will be full client site.

<h3>Showcase</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Hungarian site of Charlotte Meentzen cosmetics <a href="http://www.meentzen.hu/" target="_blank">meentzen.hu</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The site of a small company Esztetiko: hand made table decorations webshop and showcase site. (The website is still in developement.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both sites are powered by WordPress.
