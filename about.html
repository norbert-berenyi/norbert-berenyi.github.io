  Hey there! I created this site to learn about something new, witch was Jekyll, after all I decided to keep the site and post stuff... I hope you like what you see.
</p>

<h3>Current projects</h3>

<p>
  At the moment I am working at <a href="http://www.gentherm.com/" target="_blank">Gentherm</a> as a Test Labor trainee, and I am a student at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Other than these, I am working on a site <a href="http://movie42night.com/" target="_blank">Movie42Night</a>, and plenty of other small sites.
</p>

<h3>My work at Gentherm</h3>

<p>
  Gentherm is a company working with heating-cooling car seats. Hungary is specified in research and developement. At first I was working mainly with Volkswagen and Skodea seats, but after a while, I started to work on an Android project. Sadly, I am now allowed to share the code, since Gentherm owning it. The program is basicly a QR code scanner, witch helps verify the equiments used in the tests.
</p>

<p>
  Currently I'm working on a web project. I want to create a database system witch helps keep track of the tests, helps the workflow. Also every test needs to be documented, this application would create the documentation for formal tests. This idea should save between 3 to 6 hours on EVERY test report.
</p>

<h3>Movie42Night</h3>

The site recommends random movies to watch. It is using Bootsrap and the TMDB API. And is build mainly in PHP. Since the site does not use any database I am planning to upgrade it so it will be written in full client site languages.

<h3>Small projects (freelancing)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The Hungarian site of Charlotte Meentzen cosmetics <a href="http://www.meentzen.hu/" target="_blank">meentzen.hu</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The site of a small company Esztetiko: hand made table decorations webshop and showcase site. (The website is still in developement.)
  </li>
</ul>

  Both sites are powered by WordPress.
