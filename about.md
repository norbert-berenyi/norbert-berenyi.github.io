  Hey there! I created this site to learn something new, witch was [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), but I decided to post stuff here... I hope you like what you see.
</p>

## Current projects

At the moment I am working at [Gentherm](http://www.gentherm.com/) as a Test Labor trainee, and I am a student at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Other that theese I am working on a site [Movie42Night](http://movie42night.com/), and plenty of other small sites.

### Movie42Night

The site recommends random movies to watch. It is using Bootsrap and the TMDB API. And is build mainly in PHP. Since the site does not use any database I am planning to upgrade it so it will be full client site.

### Showcase

* The Hungarian site of Charlotte Meentzen cosmetics [meentzen.hu](http://www.meentzen.hu/)
* The site of a small company Esztetiko: hand made table decorations webshop and showcase site. (The website is still in progress.)

Both sites are powered by WordPress.

Thanks for reading!
