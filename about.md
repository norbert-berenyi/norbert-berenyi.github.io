_![Working hard](/images/me.jpg)_

Hey there! I created this website to learn about something new, which was `Jekyll`. After all I decided to keep the site and post stuff... And to use it as my resume, I hope you like what you see.

I am a very open person, I like to interact with the people surrounding me and I consider myself a good developer. Good and rare combination! ;)


## Current job

At the monent I am CTO in my own startup company called [Roxxare](http://www.roxxare.com). We are guiding amateur eSports teams towards their professional career. We have been selected to one of the best accelerator programs in Budapest, called [Techlab](http://www.techlab.designterminal.hu). I work on the project most of my time, but I am also a freelancer web developer.


## Programing skills

* HTML, CSS
* PHP, MySQL (Laravel, Wordpress)
* Javascript (jQuery, Vue.js)
* Java (Android development)
* Ruby on Rails (Jekyll)

I am very eager to learn new languages and frameworks, I can adapt to new things fast.


## Languages:

* Hungarian (mothertongue)
* English (fluent)
* French (beginner)


## History

I am a student of <span class="red">_Budapest University of Technology and Economics_</span> for 4 years, (BME) but I have been working next to it for the past __2 years__.


### Full time jobs

* __Gentherm__ as a developer trainee. `2014.07 - 2016.02` I have started as a techlabor technician trainee, but since I am always trying to solve the problems I face, I managed to start my own side project[^1] as a developer.
* __BME-Infokom__ as a researcher. `2013.09 - 2013.10` I was helping a team who was working with indoor positioning. My job was to gather as much information on _laser positioning_ as posible. It was a 2 month contract.

I have realised that I need to like what I do in order to work efficiently. I am really happy with freelancing, I can make a living out of it, I am only looking for __interesting__ part time jobs! :)


### Projects for fun

* __PlayersGround__ is a web app that gathers all the hungarian video game advertisements to one place. I have always had to check several sites, so I created an app for myself. Later on I decided to share it with everyone. It was built with `Laravel` and is currently [up and running](http://playersground.com).
* __Movie42Night__ is a site, that recommends random movies to watch. It is using Bootstrap and the TMDB API and built mainly in `PHP`. This project is currently down because I am rewriting it in pure `Javascript`.

These projects all started with a problem of mine that needed to be solved, but I have not find any proper alternatives for it.


### Freelancing

* Hungarian [Charlotte Meentzen](http://www.meentzen.hu/) cosmetics.
* [Esztetiko](http://www.esztetiko.hu): handmade table decorations showcase site.

All my freelancing projects are powered by [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org).

## Additional notes:

[^1]: I have realised that writing a test report from scratch takes about 4 hours for a Testlabor engineer, because every data is written on paper. I have created a web based platform, where engineers can take the test notes on tablets. With this process all of the data is digital. __The platform generates the test reports automatically__, only with a few clicks.
